## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions, and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

-   How to set up a modular JavaScript project.
-   Handling lots of DOM manipulation
-   The importance of writing simple well organized code specifically JavaScript. While writing the JS for this challenge I noticed the code was getting all over the place which then made it challenging top clean up at the end. My own fault but I learned the more organized you are from the beginning the better it will be for you down the line.
-   How to set up a light/dark theme and how to save it to local storage.
-   How to create a toggle switch.

### Continued development

-   I want to continue creating more complexed apps with more complexed logic, I am definitely getting better at it but would like to keep sharpening these skills.
-   Writing more effecient code from the beginning. I want to be able to better identify what can be abstracted or turned into resuable bits earlier on.
-   I want to start incoporating test into these projects so I can make sure they work well and not have to ask multiple people to test it out for me.
